# Advent of Code 2017

http://adventofcode.com/2017

My challenge this year is to do each day in a different language, in alphabetical order.

My criteria for picking is language is:
- something I haven't used before or have very little experience in
- a "real" language (e.g. no Brainfuck)
- perferably a language that is still in use (although I'm sure every language is still in use somewhere)

My choices so far:
1. [Ada](01-inverse-captcha/)
